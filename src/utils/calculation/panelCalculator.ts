 * Calculate panel requirements based on flow path through cubes
 * This function applies consistent rules regardless of configuration:
 * 1. Each cube has 4 edges, some of which may be exposed
 * 2. Exposed edges need panels (side, left, or right)
 * 3. Panel type is determined by flow direction:
 *    - Entry point gets left panel
 *    - Exit point gets right panel
 *    - Other exposed edges get side panels
 * 4. Connectors are determined by flow between cubes:
 *    - Straight flow = straight coupling
 *    - 90-degree turn = corner connector
