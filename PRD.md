# Cladding Cube Customizer - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Cladding Cube Customizer is a tool for calculating and visualizing the required panels and couplings for food cube configurations. It analyzes irrigation flow paths to determine the correct panel types and quantities needed for valid cube arrangements. The tool now includes a subgrid implementation where each foodcube occupies a 2x2 area within the main grid, enhancing the precision of flow analysis and visualization.

## Core Components

### 1. Flow Analysis System
- **Purpose**: Determines how irrigation flows through connected food cubes
- **Components**:
  - `flowValidator`: Validates irrigation paths through cubes and subgrids
  - `connectionDetector`: Identifies connections between cubes
  - `irrigationRules`: Defines valid flow patterns, including subgrid flow

### 2. Panel Calculation System
- **Purpose**: Calculates required panels based on flow analysis
- **Components**:
  - `panelCounter`: Counts raw panel requirements based on flow
  - `panelPacker`: Optimizes panel distribution into packs
  - `rules`: Defines panel type determination rules

### 3. Visualization System
- **Purpose**: Provides visual feedback of configurations, including subgrid details
- **Components**:
  - `CladdingVisualizer`: Shows panel placements
  - `PipelineVisualizer`: Shows irrigation flow, highlighting flow within subgrids

## Data Flow

1. **Grid Configuration Input**
   - User places cubes in grid
   - System validates cube connections
   - Flow paths are determined

2. **Flow Analysis**
   - `flowValidator` analyzes cube connections
   - Valid paths are identified
   - Flow direction through each cube and subgrid is determined

3. **Panel Calculation**
   - `panelCounter` determines raw panel needs:
     - Analyzes each cube's position and subgrid flow
     - Determines panel types (side/left/right)
     - Counts required couplings
   - `panelPacker` optimizes panel distribution:
     - Groups panels into standard packs
     - Handles special cases (L-shape, U-shape)
     - Validates final configuration

4. **Visualization**
   - Updates visual representation to include subgrid
   - Shows panel placements
   - Indicates flow direction within subgrids

## Configuration Rules

### Panel Types
- **Side Panels (Blue)**: Used in two cases:
  1. When a cube has no red flow blocks (0 red blocks)
  2. When a cube has two red flow blocks (2 red blocks)
- **Left/Right Panels**: Used when a cube has one red flow block:
  - **Left Panel (Green)**: Applied when the red block is on the left side
  - **Right Panel (Purple)**: Applied when the red block is on the right side
- **Extra Panels**: Required for turns (L-shape)

### Flow and Rotation Rules
- Red lines must form a continuous path through the cubes
- Cubes rotate to ensure proper flow connection:
  - Cube at position (2,1) rotates 180Â° to connect with the end block
  - Rotation ensures proper cladding placement (e.g., right cladding on S side when red block goes through right block)

### Standard Configurations
1. **Single Cube (4 edges)**
   - 1 four-pack (2 side + 1 left + 1 right)

2. **Three Cubes in Line (8 edges)**
   - 1 four-pack
   - 2 two-packs
   - 2 straight couplings

3. **L-Shape (8 edges)**
   - 1 four-pack
   - 1 two-packs
   - 1 extra side panel
   - 1 extra left/right panel
   - 1 corner connector
   - 1 straight coupling

4. **U-Shape (12 edges)**
   - 2 four-pack
   - 2 two-packs
   - 2 corner connectors
   - 2 straight couplings

## Validation Rules

1. **Flow Validation**
   - All cubes must be connected
   - No T-junctions allowed
   - Valid entry/exit points required

2. **Panel Validation**
   - All exposed edges must be covered
   - Panel types must match flow direction
   - Correct coupling types for connections

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - Total panel count must match edges
   - Coupling count must match connections
   - Panel packs must follow standard rules

## Technical Architecture

### Core Utilities
- `gridUtils`: Grid manipulation functions
- `debugLogger`: Debugging support
- `testUtils`: Testing helpers

### Calculation Layer
- `calculation/`: Panel counting and packing logic
- `validation/`: Flow and configuration validators
- `core/`: Fundamental rules and types

### UI Layer
- `components/`: React components
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `types/`: TypeScript definitions

## Future Considerations

1. **Extensibility**
   - Support for new cube configurations
   - Additional panel pack types
   - Custom coupling types

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize flow calculations
   - Cache common configurations
   - Reduce unnecessary recalculations

3. **Visualization**
