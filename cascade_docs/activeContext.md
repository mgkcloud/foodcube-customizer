## Current Focus
Implementing and testing subgrid functionality:
- Ensuring correct rotation logic for foodcubes
- Visualizing irrigation flow within the subgrid
- Updating documentation to reflect changes

## Recent Changes
1. Flow and Cladding Rules Verification
   - Verified continuous red line path through cubes
   - Confirmed proper cube rotation at position (2,1)
   - Validated cladding rules:
     * Side panels (blue) for 0 or 2 red blocks
     * Left panel (green) when red block is on left
     * Right panel (purple) when red block is on right
   - Documented rules in PRD.md

2. Subgrid Implementation
   - Added subgrid structure to `PathCube` interface
   - Updated `flowAnalyzer.ts` to handle subgrid logic
   - Modified `Grid.tsx` to render subgrid
   - Updated `CladdingVisualizer.tsx` to highlight subgrid

2. Rotation Logic
   - Implemented rotation logic in `flowAnalyzer.ts`
   - Ensured foodcube at (1,1) rotates to connect with neighbors
   - Created tests for rotation logic in `flowAnalyzer.test.ts`

3. Visualization Updates
   - Updated `PipelineVisualizer.tsx` to highlight irrigation flow
   - Ensured visual representation aligns with rotation logic

## Next Steps
1. Documentation Updates
   - Update `PRD.md` and `cascade_docs/` with new improvements
   - Document subgrid implementation details
   - Update progress in `progress.md`

2. Further Testing
   - Expand test coverage for various configurations
   - Add performance tests for large grids

3. Future Enhancements
   - Consider additional visual indicators for connections
   - Optimize flow analysis and visualization
